The FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, which is utility program, commonly used for copying files to and from other computer.
In my project i have implemented two program, first one is SERVER.C and another one is  CLIENT.C . 
To run SERVER.C, Just compile the program and then run ( as we did for normal c programs ) and the procedure is same for CLIENT.C 

For exemple--
    balai@balai:~$ ./client  "Server IP address"

In this project i have implement 8 ftp commands and those are--
            
                           1. ls        5. mget     
                           2. lls       6. mput
                           3. get       7. cd, lcd
                           4. put       8. bye

     ls: To list out names of the files in the current directory of the server side.
    lls: It is same as the ls, but it list out the files of the client side.
    get: To copy files from the Remote machine to the local machine.
   mget: mget is same as get, only difference is mget is used to get multiple files.
    put: To copy files from local machine to remote machine.
     cd: For changing the directory of the server side.
    lcd: lcd is same as cd, but for client side.
    bye: To  disconnection from the server.
